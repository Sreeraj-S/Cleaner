# Cleaner

## Overview

The Cleaner project is a file management tool designed to clean and organize files. It was created out of the frustration of having cluttered downloads filled with unnecessary files, taking up valuable storage space. The tool automates the process of sorting files by moving them into folders based on their extension names.

## Motivation

This project was born out of a desire to avoid the tedious task of manually organizing files. As someone who dislikes sorting files but needs a solution, the Cleaner was developed as a fun and practical way to address the issue of cluttered storage.

## Features

- **File Sorting:**
  - Moves files to folders named after their extension.

- **Deletion Rules:**
  - Deletes files larger than 500MB (0.5GB).
  - Deletes files older than 3 months.
  - Prompts user confirmation before deleting each file.

- **Future Plans:**
  - GUI implementation for a more user-friendly experience.
  - Integration of AI models to determine file importance.

## Usage

## Configuration
